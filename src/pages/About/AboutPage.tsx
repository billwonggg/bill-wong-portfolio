          Welcome! ðŸ˜Š I'm Bill, a second year Software Engineering student at UNSW. I have been
          programming since high school and I love it! I like to compete in programming
          competitions, such as the ICPC and Google Kick Start. I competed in the 2021 ICPC South
          Pacific Division and won the Auckland Site Second Prize. I enjoy spending my spare time
          learning new technologies and developing new skills. I always try and apply the knowledge
          I learned to real life projects. In fact, I completely self-learned Front-End Programming
          in my spare time, and built the website that you are looking at right now! ðŸ˜„
