      <p>I'm Bill, a computer science graduate from UNSW. I have been programming since high school and I love it!</p>
      <p>
        I enjoy spending my spare time learning new technologies and developing new skills. I always try and apply the
        knowledge I learned to real life projects, just like the one you are looking at right now!
