      <p>
        I'm Bill, a second year Software Engineering student at UNSW. I have been programming since
        high school and I love it!
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy spending my spare time learning new technologies and developing new skills. I always
        try and apply the knowledge I learned to real life projects, just like the one you are
        looking at right now! ðŸ˜„
